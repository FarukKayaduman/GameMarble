## How to Play?
To win the game, attack until your opponent is dead or cause them to leave the arena. Attack your opponent using the jump mechanic and the heights of the arena. 
- Make sure you are higher than your opponent when attacking. Otherwise, you will take damage.
- Take care to stay inside the arena during the game. When you stay outside the arena, you lose regardless of your health.
- Win the game by winning both arenas.<br/>

**Reminders**:
- You can only use the jump mechanic while touching the ground.
- You can save the game from the pause menu and continue where you left off later. <br/>
